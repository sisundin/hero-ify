HOW TO RUN

The app is publicly deployed at:

https://nomadic-buffer-271314.web.app/

HOW TO SETUP LOCALLY

Download the git repository and type in the following commands in the terminal

cd /local_path_to_repo
cd auth-server
node authorization_code/app.js

If the message you receive ends in "Listening on 8888", everything is correct.
Open up a new terminal window and type in

cd /local_path_to_repo
npm start

If there are problems in configuring authorization, you probably don't have access to our Spotify configuration keys as they are not published publicly. Ask us and we can give them to you!
